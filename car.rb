# NOTE: speed doesn't decrease to zero automatically without cruise control on.

# Not implemented:

# IDEA: Speed limiter

# IDEA: cruise control OR speed limiter, cannot be both. Buttons must detect which is on when the plus, minus, off, and resume buttons are pressed.

# IDEA: speed_limit_set - might want to rename the method to 'plus' and 'minus', rather than specifically 'cruise_plus' and 'cruise_minus' so that the method can be used for both

# IDEA: If speed limit set, don't allow accelerate to function, unless the value is significantly large, to override, i.e. foot to the floor! then allow a smaller percentage of the accelerate value to be applied. Speed should drop back down to the limit set.

# IDEA: speed_limit_off - accelerate should function as normal.

# IDEA: speed limit value resets to nil when car turned off.
